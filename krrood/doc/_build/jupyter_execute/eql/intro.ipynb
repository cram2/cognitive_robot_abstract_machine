    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Entity Query Language (EQL) is a relational query language that is pythonic, and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface side of EQL is inspired by [euROBIN](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/) entity query language white paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of EQL is that you do not need to do operations like JOIN in SQL, this is performed implicitly.\n",
    "EQL tries to mirror your intent in a query statement with as little boilerplate code as possible.\n",
    "For example, attribute access with and equal check to another value is just as you expect:"
